Git hub is a version control software that is popularly used by users/companies in order to store all of thier code/work for their project in one centralized location to make it easier for peers in the workplace to be able to have access to and edit while they all work on the project together.

First you would create an account with github with your email and password of choice. The you would create a repository where your whole project will be stored at. Afterwards you will have to link your repository to your coding application of choice when you click the green code button, my preferred choice is cmd using any of the three provided cloning commands whether it be HTTPS SSH or Github CLI. Once your coding station is connected with the github you will want to pull just to make sure your repository on your pc is up to date. After a successful pull you can now begin working or adding on new files to the github and after you are done you are able to push it to the main branch so your other coworkers can see what you have published and potentially edit what you added.


Branch - Simalarly to cloning, branches do not live on the main place of the repository and you are able to work on all content on branches without having to worry about effecting the main branch of the repository. Whenever you feel you are comfortable, you are able to merge your branch that you were working on into the main branch of the repository.

Clone - A clone is simply a copy of a repository that you choose to create a copy of. 

Commit - Commits are revisions that you made to the files that are apart of the repository you are working on. Commits can also contain completely new files that you are introducing to the repository through the commit.

Fetch - Similar to pull with Fetch you are grabbing changes that may have occurred in the repository since you last worked on it and adding them to the your machine but with the one caviot being that you can see what the changes are before you add them to your machine.

GIT - GIT is what you must place infront of all other git commands so as to make sure your computer know that you are infact committing to your repository or pull from your when you do commands such as git pull or git push. Simply putting pull or push would not do anything.

Github - Github is the centralized location for all your repositories that you may wish to create. It is service that is used by millions worldwide to host their projects on in order to make it easier for groups to work on code, commit and pull changes made in one location.

Merge - When you merge you are typically merging two branchs together, normally being your local branch into the main branch of your repository so as to make sure that your changes are saved. 

Merge Conflict - Merge conflict occurs when the two branches are unable to merge due to there being a conflict with one of the files. This usually means that there is a line of code that is different on one file than it is on the other file and must be resolve by you going in and adjusting it accordingly.

Push - When you are pushing you are committing any changes that you have made to the repository on your local compute and pushing them onto the main repository for it to be saved and for any other coworkers to then be able to pull and work off of your changes.

Pull - When you are pulling you are fetching for any changes that may have occurred in the repository since you last worked on it and bringing them over to your machine so as to make sure that your machine has the latest and up to date commitments for the repository.

Remote - Remote is simply a repository that is being hosted on a server.

Repository - A repository is the main 'folder' you can call it that stores all your necessary files for the project that you are working on in that 'folder'.
